# Test Workflow: AIOS-Core Analysis

**Context:** Testing the AIOS Squad's ability to analyze its own source code and suggest a new feature.

**Requirement:**
Analyze the `test-project/` (aios-core) and create a User Story for a new agent called `@budget-monitor`, which should implement the token calculation logic we discussed earlier.

**Steps for Squad Alpha:**
1. **@analyst**: Research existing agent patterns in the codebase.
2. **@pm**: Create the story for the `@budget-monitor` agent.
3. **@architect**: Define the technical structure for this new agent.

**Handoff:** Execute `*create-story` for the Budget Monitor feature.
